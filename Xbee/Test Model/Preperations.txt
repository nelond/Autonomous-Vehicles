Download serial port monitoring program
http://realterm.sourceforge.net/


connect Xbee usb module to your pc
use device manager to find out which COM number it is (mine is COM5)
This will only work if you have the FTDI drivers installed!!
connect NXTbee to your Lego NXT. Make sure it is turned on and you will see the blue LED turn on
In this example the LegoNXT is just a big battery for the NXTbee

Before we simulink, lets make sure the Xbee's work with realterm.
Open realterm. Open COM# (use device manager to determine which COM# Xbee is in)
Configure the settings for COM# under the 'port' tab
*see RealTerm_Config.png *
8 bits
no parity
1 stop bit
9600 baud rate
little Endian
no terminators or headers
Configure display under 'display' tab
select the HEX bubble
You are connected and configured! Now to send data to Xbee
Go to 'send' tab and copy paste this into the text field
0x7E 0x00 0x04 0x08 0x01 0x4E 0x44 0x64
This command tells the Xbee to ping all other Xbee's in range. Other Xbee's return
with the first half of their MAC address.
Hit 'Send Numbers'
RealTerm will display data read from the Xbee.
*see RealTerm_Send.png *

If this was a success, open NXTbee.slx

The only change to the model you need to make is the COM# in the Serial Configure block
All other parameters are set correctly
The CMD feeding into the Serial Send block is the same as what we used for RealTerm
I used init8 units to convert int to hex (because Simulink doesnt support 0xFF)
[126 0 4 8 1 78 68 100 ]

Hit simulte and watch the display connected to Serial Recieve update with data.



Follow this tutorial to make sure your Xbee's are working
