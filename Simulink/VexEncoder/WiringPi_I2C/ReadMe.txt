Wait! Before you even THINK of downloading Simulink Code and trying it out you MUST:

Install WiringPi on your Raspberry Pi
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

Install a compatable SDK for you computer
http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/upgrading-mex-files-to-use-64-bit-api.html

Configure MatLAB to include WiringPi when compiling your code on the Raspberry Pi
<look in Supporting Documentation folder>

Make sure you GPIO Pins are correctly connected
<look in the previous folder for the Encoder Schematic picture>
