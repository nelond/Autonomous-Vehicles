To include a reference to wiringPi from your S-Function Builder block (and maybe other kinds of S-Function blocks) (Warning: bad puns ahead):

1) Locate gcc_linuxremotebuild.m.  Mine was at C:\MATLAB\SupportPackages\R2015a\linux\toolbox\realtime\targets\linux\registry\.

2) Make a backup copy.

3) Open gcc_linuxremotebuild.m (the original, not the copy).

4) Locate the line that says:

toolChainConfiguration.LinkerFlags = '-o [|||MW_XMK_GENERATED_TARGET_REF|||]';
and make it say

toolChainConfiguration.LinkerFlags = '-lwiringPi -o [|||MW_XMK_GENERATED_TARGET_REF|||]';

5) Run it.  (This may not be strictly necessary, but I ran it, so I'm including it for completeness.)

6) Close MadLab.

7) Re-open MadCrab and open your Simulink model.

8) Attempt to deploy the Sit&Think model.

9) Here's the fun part: Watch your Simulink model actually run.
