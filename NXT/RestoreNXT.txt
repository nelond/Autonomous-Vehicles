SYMPTOMS!
1) NXT brick is clicking and unresponsive
2) RobotC and Mindstorm software can't locate NXT
3) Device Manager labes the NXT as a 'Bossa' device

What's the diagnoses?
Your NXT is fine but your compy thinks the NXT is an arduino device. NXT and a certain Arduino
device have the same processor so when the NXT is in 'boot mode' your compy decides to label
it as an Arduino.

What's the cure?
Force your compy to accept the NXT as the NXT it really is.

1) Disconnect your compy from the internet 
2) Make sure NXT is still connected and turned on to compy
2) Open device manager and uninstall the device listed as 'Bossa port'
2) Find the oem files that identify NXT as arduino
	1. Make sure the NXT brick is still connected to the computer.
	2. Open an elevated CMD.
	3. Type "cd c:\Windows\inf"
	4. Type "findstr Bossa *.inf"
	5. Note the INF file name in the form of oemxx.inf
	6. Go to C:\Windows\INF and find the oemxx.inf files
	7. Cut it and paste to a secure location
3) Download firmware to the NXT
